### Challenge Statement

IUU (illegal, unreported and unregulated) fishing and modern-day slavery are
rampant within the fishing industry. Creating a tool for companies to use
internally for risk assessment, where they could cross-check their production
volumes and catch species with high risk regions where these activities are more
likely to occur, would allow companies to to collect and synthesize data on the
geographical occurrence of these activities, and hence work towards avoiding
fishing and purchasing catch from these areas.

### Possible Solution

The idea is to develop a decision-making tool that allows a company
representative to assess the risks associated with their activities (fishing,
aquaculture and feeds production, sourcing of raw materials), particularly in
relation to illegal fishing, modern slavery and related corruption risks. These
are global risks, but tend to be concentrated around particular regions and/or
in catching a particular fish stock.

Imagine the following reality for a transnational seafood corporation:

“We have a code of conduct for our own operations and for our suppliers (PDF:
http://hckrn.st/2ACr6aJ). We source raw materials from 200 suppliers annually,
which together provide 100 different species of fish from 50 countries. The
value chains associated with these suppliers are long and complex. How do we
ensure that we comply with our code of conduct and are prioritizing where, who
and how we audit our suppliers? Is there a smart system of auditing that is
based on risk – and is there a way to integrate and analyze different forms of
risk?

More specifically:

I am evaluating if we should fish <species> in the <location> and wish to have
information about the risks involved in doing so and whether or not we could do
this in line with our commitments about illegal fishing and modern slavery.

If we do go forward with this decision, I wish to know what risks I am facing so
we can design mitigation strategies to deal with those risks. Is this a region
with a) high or low risk of IUU fishing, b) a region where there have recently
been instances of human rights abuses, c) a region known for limited capacity
among government agencies, or d) a region with widespread problems of
corruption? I want a tool to be able to assess how large the risks are when I
engage in trading suspect products.

I am considering working with <supplier> whose vessels have the following vessel
numbers. Should I have any concerns about the operation of these vessels?

### Resources

There are two types of datasets that need to be meshed in order to achieve this outcome:

- Risks datasets: there are datasets of the various ‘bad’ activities. This can
  include estimated levels of illegal fishing (http://hckrn.st/2zYcXoM), number
  of apprehended illegal vessels, recorded instances of human rights abuses
  (PDF: http://hckrn.st/2zZ3r56), indexes of corruption, and much more. Such
  data are not prepared on a standard basis and are not designed for use by
  individual decision makers. We are in the process of collecting and
  aggregating this type of data for use, but can for now provide one dataset for
  practice purposes (Google Sheet: http://hckrn.st/2jGy8Rv).
- A second dataset including a list of species names and volumes sourced by a
  company (species name, catch location, volume caught, supplier name, vessel
  name, etc.) (http://hckrn.st/2AE8kjh). You can also check out the list of
  companies part of the Ocean Disclosure Project (http://hckrn.st/2iFNF7F).
- Ram Legacy dataset (http://hckrn.st/2EXPfr1), which is a compilation of stock
  assessment results for commercially exploited marine populations from around
  the world.

What we wish to investigate is whether (or not - and if so how) these first two
datasets could be integrated together to support the decision maker. In plain
language: “I have an excel sheet of all my purchases made during last year, how
do I know which ones I should worry about? Is species X in region Y a problem?
Is there a risk that I do not comply with my code of conduct?”

There are scale issues to overcome in making this possible – that is, the risks
dataset may be on a different scale than the operational datasets. Some
mechanism by which this mismatch could be dealt with will be needed.

Likewise, the datasets themselves are likely to be of a coarse/finer-grained
nature and the extent to which different levels of detail can be accommodated in
a decision tool would be a relevant consideration.

Data quality in the risks dataset is likely to be variable. A way of evaluating
the possible impact of different degrees of certainty in the datasets would be
helpful – for example, we may wish to present users with some sense of the
degrees of confidence in the output of the tool.
The decisions that are being made by the users of any tool/tools may also want
data at different levels of resolution from a strategic decision about a region
or fisheries to operate in and/or to a specific supplier relationship. These
different decisions might require different tools or nested tools.

### Possible useful images

- Anything off the keystone dialogues website (http://hckrn.st/2zYjPTi)
- Google searches like “modern slavery in fishing” to see examples of people
  being rescued
- Some front shots of articles that deal with these aspects, especially if they
  have great graphics
- SRC Corruption dataset (Google Sheet: http://hckrn.st/2r73XcV)
- Example of what a fishery company (one that goes out with actual vessels)
  might note down as their raw material inputs (Google Sheet:

- Freedom In The World dataset (Google Sheet: http://hckrn.st/2DAtVYS)
- The Freedom In the World dataset is what is used by Freedom House to publish
  its flagship publication. That publication is a comparative assessment of
  global political rights and civil liberties. It has been published annually
  since 1972, and the survey ratings and narrative reports on 195 countries and
  14 related and disputed territories are used by policymakers, the media,
  international corporations, civic activists, and human rights defenders.
